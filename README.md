# Jokernaut

The site is deployed on Heroku, here [Jokernaut](https://salty-tundra-59770.herokuapp.com)

### Jokernaut is a web application built for comedians to help write and organize jokes.

It allows comedians to write, save, organize, rate, and estimate the duration of jokes as well create setlists out of their jokes.

Jokernaut is built using Node.js. It has an Express backend and uses PostgreSQL for the database. I used knex for migrations and seeds. The frontend is built using React along with React Router and Redux. 

### Future Features

- [ ] Responsive for mobile phones. Making it easy to take your jokes and setlists to shows everywhere
- [ ] Help you brainstorm topics to write jokes about
- [ ] Help edit and remove unnecessary words from jokes
- [ ] Have a calendar to keep track of shows
