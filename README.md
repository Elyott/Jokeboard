# Jokernaut
### Is a web application built for comedians to help write and organize jokes.

It allows comedians to write, save, organize, rate, and estimate the duration of jokes as well create setlists of the jokes.

Jokernaut is built using Node.js. It has an Express backend and uses PostgreSQL for the database. I used knex for migrations and seeds. The frontend is built using React along with React Router and Redux. 

The site is deployed on Heroku, here [Jokernaut](https://salty-tundra-59770.herokuapp.com)
